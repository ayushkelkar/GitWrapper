# GitWrapper

**GitWrapper** is a Python-based CLI tool that wraps your basic Git commands â€” `add`, `commit`, and `push` 

---

##  Features

- Basically automate the Git-process like `add`, `commit -m`, and `push`. 

---

## Uses:

- **Python 3.15.3**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
 - None. Clone this Repository, and run the `gitwrapper_cli.py` script directly. I'll eventually make a `.exe` or something like that, not now though.
